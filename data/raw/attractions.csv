The Cu Chi Tunnels played a surprisingly successful role in the various wars that Vietnam has experienced, so it has become a legendary and popular attraction. The Cu Chi Tunnel is 250 kilometers long and is composed of numerous tunnels less than 80 cm wide, which are divided into three layers, and the third layer is 8 meters deep. Each floor is equipped with air holes extending to the ground indistinctly. There are wells, granaries, conference rooms, and dormitories in the tunnels, like a large military camp. The first floor has to walk in a half-squatting manner, the second floor may have to kneel to advance, and the third floor may even need to crawl forward. Through personal experience, go deep into the authentic, and be shocked by the indomitable national character of the Vietnamese. The tunnel is narrow and there is no room for movement, and it won't take long for you to sweat profusely.
